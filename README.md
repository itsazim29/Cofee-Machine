# Cofee-Machine
A coffee machine simulation in Python represents an interactive system where users can operate a virtual coffee maker. This simulation typically involves managing resources such as water, milk, and coffee beans, while offering different types of coffee like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The coffee machine maintains a balance of these resources and ensures they are sufficient before preparing a drink. It also includes a pricing system where users can pay for their coffee, and the machine processes this payment to handle transactions.

In this simulation, the coffee machine responds to user inputs, such as requests for different types of coffee, and provides reports on resource levels and financial status. The simulation checks if the required ingredients are available, processes the payment, and deducts the necessary amounts from the resources. It can also handle cases where the user doesn't provide enough money by refunding the payment. This kind of program is useful for understanding basic object-oriented programming principles, as it involves creating classes, managing state, and interacting with users through a command-line interface or graphical user interface.
